# Chapter 3: Core Concepts - Exercises

This directory contains hands-on exercises to reinforce the core concepts covered in Chapter 3.

## Overview

These exercises build progressively, starting with function selection and moving through variable expansion, context management, and response handling. Each exercise includes starter code, requirements, and validation tests.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Function Category Selection ⭐
**File:** `exercise1.md`
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Topics:** Function categories, API selection
**Time:** 20-30 minutes

Learn to choose the right gocurl function for different scenarios. Implement multiple API calls using appropriate function categories.

### Exercise 2: Variable Expansion System ⭐⭐
**File:** `exercise2.md`
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Topics:** Environment variables, WithVars functions
**Time:** 30-40 minutes

Build a multi-environment configuration system using automatic and explicit variable expansion.

### Exercise 3: Context Management ⭐⭐
**File:** `exercise3.md`
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Topics:** Timeouts, cancellation, context propagation
**Time:** 30-40 minutes

Implement proper context handling patterns including timeout management and graceful cancellation.

### Exercise 4: Response Processing Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐
**File:** `exercise4.md`
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Topics:** Response handling, error handling, retry logic
**Time:** 45-60 minutes

Create a complete response processing pipeline with error handling, retries, and proper status code validation.

## Getting Help

- Review the chapter content in `chapter.md`
- Check the examples in `../examples/`
- Refer to the GoCurl API documentation
- Test your code incrementally

## Validation

Each exercise includes:
- ✅ Clear requirements
- ✅ Starter code template
- ✅ Expected output examples
- ✅ Self-check criteria

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the requirements carefully** - Understand what's being asked before coding
2. **Test incrementally** - Run your code after each function implementation
3. **Use the examples** - Refer to chapter examples for similar patterns
4. **Error handling** - Always include proper error checking
5. **Code style** - Follow Go conventions and best practices

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises:
- Move to Chapter 4: CLI
- Build a more complex project using gocurl
- Explore advanced features in later chapters
