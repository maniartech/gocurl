- ✅ Shell scripts tested and functional

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part I, readers can:

1. **Understand GoCurl's Value Proposition**
   - When to use GoCurl vs alternatives
   - Design philosophy and benefits
   - Real-world use cases

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install library and CLI tool
   - Configure IDE
   - Verify installation
   - Troubleshoot common issues

3. **Master Core Concepts**
   - Choose appropriate function category
   - Use correct variant (basic, Command, Args)
   - Expand variables (environment + explicit)
   - Handle contexts (timeout, cancellation)
   - Process responses correctly
   - Handle errors gracefully

4. **Use CLI Tool Effectively**
   - Execute basic and advanced requests
   - Debug with verbose output
   - Script with bash/shell
   - Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
   - Format output for automation
   - Switch between environments

### Technical Discoveries

During development, we discovered several API constraints:

1. **WithVars Family:** Only basic variants exist (no String/Bytes/JSON/Download)
2. **Return Values:** WithVars returns `(*http.Response, error)`, must read body manually
3. **Variable Expansion:** WithVars does NOT expand env vars (only uses provided map)
4. **Process Function:** Returns 3 values: `(*http.Response, string, error)`
5. **Internal APIs:** Some functions like `ParseCommand` are not suitable for public examples

These discoveries led to more accurate examples and better documentation.

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Discovery is Critical:** Many assumptions about the API were incorrect until verified against the actual codebase
2. **Real Examples > Theoretical:** Using actual APIs (httpbin.org, GitHub, etc.) makes examples more practical
3. **Progressive Complexity Works:** Starting simple and building up helps readers learn effectively
4. **Shell Scripts Need Testing:** CLI examples required more testing than Go code
5. **Exercises Reinforce Learning:** Hands-on exercises are essential for skill development
