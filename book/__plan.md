## 📝 Notes

### Target Reader Profile
**Name:** Alex (Software Engineer)
**Experience:** 2 years with Go, 5 years total programming
**Current Challenge:** Integrating multiple third-party APIs (Stripe, GitHub, AWS)
**Pain Points:**
- Tired of writing boilerplate HTTP client code
- `net/http` feels too low-level for simple tasks
- Copy-pasting curl commands from docs, then translating to Go
- Performance issues with high-volume API calls
- Testing API clients is tedious

**What Alex Wants:**
- Copy curl commands directly from API docs → working Go code
- Production-ready patterns (security, retries, timeouts)
- Performance that beats `net/http`
- Easy testing
- Real examples (not toy demos)

**After Reading This Book, Alex Can:**
- Integrate any REST API in minutes
- Build high-performance API clients (10k+ req/s)
- Write production-ready, secure API code
- Test API clients comprehensively
- Design reusable SDK wrappers
