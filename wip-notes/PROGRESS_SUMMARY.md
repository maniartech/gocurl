## Conclusion

**Current Status**: ✅ **60% COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY FOR MOST USE CASES**

### What Works Now
- Complete curl command parsing
- All HTTP methods with retries
- Variable substitution
- Security hardening
- Thread-safe operation
- Efficient resource management
- CLI tool ready

### What's Left
- Full feature completion (proxy, compression, cookies)
- Load/stress/chaos testing
- Documentation polish
- v1.0 release preparation

### Recommendation
The library is **production-ready for most use cases** today:
- ✅ Use for API integrations
- ✅ Use for CLI tools
- ✅ Use for concurrent applications
- ✅ Use where retry logic is critical
- ✅ Use where security matters

Wait for Week 4-5 completion for:
- Full proxy support needs
- Cookie persistence requirements
- Extreme load scenarios (>10k req/s)
- Mission-critical production (wait for load testing)
