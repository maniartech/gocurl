## Implementation Philosophy: SSR

### Sweet (Developer Experience)
- Copy-paste curl commands work directly
- Identical CLI-to-code syntax
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Convenience methods (response.JSON(), response.String())
- No surprises, predictable behavior

### Simple (Implementation)
- No over-engineering
- Clear data flow: Parse → Convert → Execute → Respond
- One purpose per component
- Minimal dependencies
- Maintainable codebase

### Robust (Military-Grade)
- **Zero-allocation** on critical path (parsing, headers, URL building)
- **Thread-safe** by design (all public APIs concurrent-safe)
- **Race-free** (proven with -race detector under load)
- **Load tested** (10k req/s sustained, 100k concurrent)
- **Stress tested** (breaking point found and documented)
- **Chaos tested** (handles failures gracefully)
- **Fuzz tested** (100M+ iterations without crashes)

## Critical Issues Identified & Solutions

### P0 Blocker #1: Broken Token Conversion
**Problem:** `convert.go` sets method to flag instead of consuming next token value
**Solution:** Fix iteration logic to consume value tokens after flag tokens
**Code:** Detailed fix provided in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### P0 Blocker #2: Nil Pointer Panics
**Problem:** Never initializes Headers/Form/QueryParams maps
**Solution:** Initialize all maps in NewRequestOptions()
**Impact:** Fixes all copy-paste workflow crashes

### P0 Blocker #3: Missing High-Level API
**Problem:** Documented API (Request, Variables, etc.) doesn't exist
**Solution:** Create api.go with public API matching docs
**File:** New file with complete implementation guide

### P0 Blocker #4: No Working CLI
**Problem:** cmd/ contains unrelated tool, no gocurl binary
**Solution:** Build cmd/gocurl/main.go using same code path as library
**Impact:** Enables CLI-to-code workflow
