Based on the `RequestOptions` struct and the code we've discussed, you've covered many essential request options for handling HTTP and HTTP/2 protocols in GoCurl. However, to ensure comprehensive support and functionality, there are some additional considerations and potential gaps to address:

### HTTP and HTTP/2 Specific Options

1. **HTTP Version Enforcement**:
   - **Current Implementation**: You have `HTTP2` and `HTTP2Only` fields in your `RequestOptions`.
   - **Consideration**: Ensure that your HTTP client respects these settings. Go's `net/http` package automatically enables HTTP/2 when using HTTPS if the server supports it. However, to enforce HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 explicitly, you might need additional configuration.
   - **Action**:
     - For HTTP/2-only connections, you can use the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package to create a custom transport that enforces HTTP/2.
     - For HTTP/1.1-only connections, set `TLSNextProto` in your `http.Transport` to an empty map to disable HTTP/2.

2. **HTTP/2 Prior Knowledge**:
   - **Missing Option**: cURL provides `--http2-prior-knowledge` to use HTTP/2 without TLS.
   - **Implementation**: You might want to add a field like `HTTP2PriorKnowledge` in `RequestOptions` and configure the transport accordingly.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

3. **TLS Versions and Cipher Suites**:
   - **Consideration**: Allow specifying minimum and maximum TLS versions, as well as preferred cipher suites.
   - **Action**:
     - Add fields like `MinTLSVersion` and `MaxTLSVersion` in `RequestOptions`.
     - Configure `TLSConfig` with these settings.

4. **Server Name Indication (SNI)**:
   - **Missing Option**: Ability to set the `ServerName` in `tls.Config`, useful when the server certificate does not match the hostname.
   - **Action**:
     - Add a `TLSServerName` field to `RequestOptions`.

### Additional cURL Options Not Yet Covered

5. **HTTP Headers Manipulation**:
   - **`--raw`**: Send the "raw" HTTP request without normalizations.
   - **Implementation**: If required, allow options to prevent automatic header modifications.

6. **Expect 100-Continue**:
   - **`--expect100-timeout`**: Control wait time for a 100-continue response.
   - **Action**:
     - Add a field like `ExpectContinueTimeout` in `RequestOptions` and configure it in `http.Transport`.

7. **Interface Binding**:
   - **`--interface`**: Perform operations using a specific network interface.
   - **Implementation**: Use `DialContext` in a custom `net.Dialer` to bind to a specific interface.

8. **HTTP Compression Control**:
   - **Decompression**: Control whether to automatically decompress response bodies.
   - **Action**:
     - Use `Transport.DisableCompression` in `http.Transport`.

### Proxy Enhancements

9. **Proxy Authentication**:
   - **Missing Option**: Handling proxy username and password.
   - **Action**:
     - Add `ProxyBasicAuth` to `RequestOptions` to store proxy credentials.
     - Configure the proxy URL with credentials.

10. **SOCKS Proxy Support**:
    - **Missing Option**: cURL supports SOCKS proxies (e.g., `--socks5`).
    - **Implementation**: Use `golang.org/x/net/proxy` package to add SOCKS proxy support if needed.

### Connection Reuse and Timeouts

11. **Keep-Alive Settings**:
    - **Missing Option**: Control over keep-alive behavior.
    - **Action**:
      - Add fields like `DisableKeepAlives` or `IdleConnTimeout` in `RequestOptions`.
      - Configure these in `http.Transport`.

12. **Detailed Timeout Settings**:
    - **Current Implementation**: You have `Timeout` and `ConnectTimeout`.
    - **Consideration**: Also consider timeouts for TLS handshake and response header.
    - **Action**:
      - Add `TLSHandshakeTimeout` and `ResponseHeaderTimeout` fields.

### Advanced Features

13. **HTTP Pipelining**:
    - **Note**: While not commonly used due to HTTP/2 multiplexing, cURL supports pipelining.
    - **Implementation**: Go's `net/http` does not support HTTP pipelining for HTTP/1.1, and it's generally unnecessary with HTTP/2.

14. **Custom DNS Resolution**:
    - **`--resolve`**: Provide custom IP addresses for a hostname and port pair.
    - **Action**:
      - Implement custom DNS resolution using `DialContext` in a custom `net.Dialer`.

15. **Content Transfer Encoding**:
    - **Missing Option**: Control over content transfer encodings.
    - **Action**:
      - Set appropriate headers or handle encodings manually if needed.

### Error Handling and Logging

16. **Detailed Error Information**:
    - **Consideration**: Provide options to capture detailed error information for debugging.
    - **Action**:
      - Enhance `RequestMetrics` to include error details.
      - Implement logging based on `Verbose` and `Silent` settings.

### Testing and Compliance

17. **Protocol Compliance**:
    - **HTTP/2 Requirements**: Ensure that the client complies with HTTP/2 specifications, such as proper frame handling.
    - **Action**:
      - Use Go's `http2` package, which handles compliance internally.
      - Test against HTTP/2 test servers.

### Summary

While your current `RequestOptions` structure is robust and covers many common use cases, especially for HTTP/1.1, ensuring full support for HTTP/2 may require the following:

- **Explicit HTTP Version Control**: Add fields or enhance existing ones to enforce specific HTTP versions.
- **Advanced TLS Configuration**: Provide detailed TLS settings, including version constraints and server name indication.
- **Proxy and Network Controls**: Include comprehensive proxy settings, including authentication and SOCKS support.
- **Timeouts and Performance**: Offer granular timeout settings and control over connection behaviors like keep-alives.
- **Testing**: Rigorously test your implementation with servers that support different HTTP versions to ensure correct behavior.

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Missing Options**:
   - Based on the above considerations, update your `RequestOptions` and parsing logic to include any missing options relevant to HTTP and HTTP/2.

2. **Configure HTTP Client Correctly**:
   - Ensure that when constructing the HTTP client and transport, all the options from `RequestOptions` are appropriately applied.

3. **Enhance Parsing Logic**:
   - Update your `ConvertTokensToRequestOptions` function to parse additional cURL flags that affect HTTP versions and TLS settings.

4. **Testing**:
   - Create test cases for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests.
   - Use servers or services that require specific TLS versions or HTTP protocols.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the supported options and any deviations from cURL's behavior, especially in areas where Go's `net/http` package differs.

### Conclusion

Overall, you've covered most of the essential request options for basic HTTP and HTTPS requests. To fully support both HTTP and HTTP/2 protocols in GoCurl, consider implementing the additional options and configurations mentioned above.

If you have specific features or behaviors in mind that aren't covered yet—such as enforcing HTTP/2-only connections or handling complex TLS configurations—please let me know, and I can provide more detailed guidance on implementing those features.
